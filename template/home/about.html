              <p>Gargi Memorial Institute of Technology (GMIT), an engineering institute in West Bengal was started in 2011 by Mallabhum Human Resource Development Trust (MHRDT) in memory of Lt. Gargi Mukherjee (Banerjee).
                
                <br>
                Barely in its 5th year, GMIT has been ranked 8th amongst all emerging engineering colleges in India because of its educational excellence and professional infrastructural facilities.
                
              <br>
                At GMIT, we always believed that an educational institution is only good for its faculty. That’s why we have gone out of our way to pick top – draw faculty for each of our departments, including former professors of IIT, foreign University, and Jadavpur University. GMIT currently offers courses in five disciplines namely Civil Engineering (CE), Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Electrical Engineering (EE), Mechanical Engineering (ME) and Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). GMIT is approved by All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) and affiliated to Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (MAKAUT), previously known as West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT).
                
                <br>
                The physical design of the campus consisting of landscape, gardens and horizontal architecture blends organically into its surroundings. GMIT has already roped in international collaboration to facilitate in-class real time learning using advanced technology along with exposure to global trends in industries.
                
              <br>
                The Institute is located on the southern fringe of Kolkata, at Baruipur, an upcoming satellite town and caters to students from reputed schools of India

                            <h3>Message from Chairman: Prof. G.L. Dutta</h3>
                        
                           <p> Setting up and running a technical institution in today’s dynamic academic environment is a big challenge and also to step into the shoes of GMIT's Founder-Chairman - Late Shri Dhurjoti Banerjee will be a daunting task. Being a Former Dean from IIT Kharagpur, I know what it takes to run such an institute. Although a lot has changed since I was a student, the basic requirement of being profitably employed after acquiring a professional degree has remained a constant. But there seems to be a gap between what companies are looking for and what the workforce is offering. This gap is what GMIT, with its focus on overall development of students, hope to address. Our aim is to build an achiever culture driven by ‘the Mantra of Success’. This is why our aim at GMIT is to create an innovation oriented mindset that encourages students to ask questions and nurture the risk-taking side of their personalities. The quest for knowledge never ends. And as the chairman of GMIT, I dream of leading the institution to a pinnacle of success. I, therefore, invite all our stakeholders–students, guardians, potential employers and all GMITians, in general – to actively participate in making our mission a reality. I wish all our students a prosperous and meaningful future. </p>

                            <h3>Vice Chairman's Thought : Mr. Bodhisattva Banerjee
                            </h3>
                            <p>From my experience as an engineer and a Management Graduate from Germany, I understand how important proactive vision is for taking an institute forward. My motto is to make GMIT one of the top institutes not just in West Bengal, but in India as well.

And this is how I plan to go about realizing this motto:<br/>

1. Our strength is our excellent faculty and we hope to continue the trend of recruiting and retaining good faculty. We plan to achieve this via various faculty development programs, pro-employee HR policies and adherence to best practices in the industry.<br/>

2. Within the campus, I plan to inculcate a culture and environment that is international and professional in flavour and yet warm and vibrant.<br/>

3. I plan to initiate soft skills training and personality development programs alongside the regular curriculum to enable students to face interviews confidently and be productive as professionals.</br>

4. I plan to create an industry-academia connect whereby students can be familiar with industry trends and demands. We’ll do this through guest lectures by corporate houses on campus and call the initiative the ‘Saturday Corporate Matinee Program’.</br>

5. We plan to introduce exchange programs with foreign universities. At present, we are collaborating with universities in Germany, France and the US, with a view to incorporating cross-culture training in our curriculum in the future.<br/>

6. Finally, I plan to promote our Entrepreneurship Development Cell and incubation facilities with the aim of making our students well rounded professionals alive to social and ethical issues.</p>

                            <h3>From Director's Desk: Dr. Parasar Bandyopadhyay
                            </h3>
                            <p>GMIT is one of the fastest emerging engineering colleges of the country and has been engaging with leaders as well as updating internally to cut through the employability challenges. Suitable fine tuning in training curriculum and pedagogy after interacting with top industry leaders on a regular basis is a distinguishing feature of the Career Development Cell of GMIT.

Keeping in mind the current recruitment trend of the industry, we have offered many placement opportunities to our final year students with prestigious organizations which are both rewarding and relevant to the course of their study.

We cultivate an inclusive mindset amongst our students in terms of their employability. Our best in-class employability orientation program focuses on developing both their domain competence and interpersonal skills. We have entered into strategic alliances with NSIC Technical Services Centre which directly feeds into strengthening academic inputs as well as acquisition of professional qualification. In addition, students are rigorously trained on effective communication, leadership, behavioural, analytical and quantitative skills throughout their semesters. We constantly encourage students to take part in various activities on or off campus to enhance their social, cultural and leadership skills. Our long term association with renowned national chambers and industry chapters like CII, NASSCOM, BCCI, IGCC, EDI (BNCCI), ISHRAE, NEN etc. continuously support us in this pursuit.I wish all the best to all the aspirant students.
